// if statement
/*
if () {

}
()-is the condition that if true will execute the code inside {}
the condition is about a boolean 
NOTE if the condition is false, it will automatically move to the next line, to execute the else statement


// example
// lets say david is ready to marry or not
const ageForMarriage = 30;

if (ageForMarriage >= 28) {
    const marriage = `Yes David can get married`
    console.log(marriage); // this prints that if david is at the age of 28 - 30, he can get married
}

// now lets create an else statement
// lets say david is not of age to marry
const marriageAge = 27;
let marriageCondition;
let personAge = 90;
if (marriageAge <= personAge) {
    marriageCondition = `Yes, David is ready for marriage`
} else {
    const yearsLeft = marriageAge - personAge;
    marriageCondition = `Wait ${yearsLeft} more years before you marry`;
}
console.log(marriageCondition)







// type coercion and type conversion
// Type conversion, changing strings to numbers
console.log(`


`)
const inputYear = '1991'
console.log(Number(inputYear));


// Type coercion
console.log('I am ' + 18 + ' Years Old')
console.log(12 - 12 + '10');
